And New Delhi, which by many measures now has far more polluted air than Beijing? So far, the green panel has ordered that no diesel cars be registered in the city for the next few weeks, and has discouraged the government from buying diesels for government fleets. Officials, meanwhile, have suggested everything from car-free days to planting more trees to dedicated bus lanes.It amounts to little more than vague promises, and is resulting in increasingly angry headlines."As Delhi debates, Beijing declares war on pollution," The Times of India sneered on its front page last week, when Beijing announced the red alert."Delhi has started very late" in the fight against air pollution, said Vivek Chattopadhyaya, who studies air quality for the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment. "Many people in Delhi are not even aware that what they see in the morning is not fog, its smog," he said. "They don't realize what kind of pollutants they are breathing."In New Delhi, that time has come. In winter, when winds die down in northern India, a cloud of pollution now often clings to the capital.Blue skies are rarities. Respiratory illnesses have spiked, doctors say, and the stink makes it impossible to confuse pollution anymore with fog."It is not safe at all," said Ankur Jain, a 35-year-old father of two whose New Delhi neighborhood is regularly rated the most polluted in the city. A government employee, Mr Jain is looking for work elsewhere, worried that pollution will cut short the lives of everyone in his family.Changing attitudes, experts say, may finally bring change.
Last month, Beijing issued its highest smog alert of the year following air pollution in capital city reached hazardous levels as smog engulfed large parts of the country despite efforts to clean up the foul air. (AP Photo)
